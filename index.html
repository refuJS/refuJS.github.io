      <p>We are trying to organize a coding school for refugees in Hamburg. A coding school is a event where people can learn how to program something, our programming language of choice is JavaScript. Our goal with the coding school is to integrate more people into the JavaScript community in Hamburg and maybe create the connection between interested refugees and companies for Jobs, Trainee positions or Internships.</p>
